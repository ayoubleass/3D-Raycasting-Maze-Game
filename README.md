3D Raycasting Game
    Overview
    This project is a 3D game developed using raycasting. It offers an immersive experience, simulating a 3D environment with a focus on performance and simplicity.

    Requirements
    To run the game, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:

    SDL2 Library: The Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) version 2.x is required for this project. Install SDL2 on your system by following the instructions appropriate for your operating system.
    Directory Setup: You need to create a directory named mingw_dev_lib in the root of your C: drive (C:/mingw_dev_lib). Place the SDL2 library files inside this directory to allow the game to compile and run without issues.
    Build and Run
    To compile the code and run the executable, follow these steps:

    Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.

    Run the following command:

    bash
    Copier le code
    make
    This will compile the game and create the executable file.

    After the build process completes, the game should automatically run. If not, locate the executable file and run it manually.

    Troubleshooting
    Ensure that the SDL2 library is correctly installed and that the mingw_dev_lib directory contains the necessary files.
    If the build process fails, double-check that make is properly installed and configured on your
